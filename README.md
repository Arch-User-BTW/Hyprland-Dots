Waybar config based on the one from [m4xshen's dotfiles](https://github.com/m4xshen/dotfiles)


Screenshot and GTK Theme scripts are based on [Arcolinux](https://arcolinux.com/) ones.


Firefox css is a Catppuccinified version of [WhiteSur Firefox Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-firefox-theme)


Colors section of kitty config is a tweaked version of [Catppuccin Kitty](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty)
