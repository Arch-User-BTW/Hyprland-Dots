## Credits

Waybar config based on the one from [m4xshen's dotfiles](https://github.com/m4xshen/dotfiles).


Screenshot and GTK Theme scripts are based on [Arcolinux](https://arcolinux.com/) ones.


Firefox css is a Catppuccinified version of [WhiteSur Firefox Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-firefox-theme).


Colors section of kitty config is a tweaked version of [Catppuccin for Kitty](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty).


## Notes

The Firefox css only uses Catppuccin colors when using dark mode

If you plan on using my dotfiles you should certainly look through and change the contents of the hypr folder to suit your needs.

Most parts of these dotfiles go in ~/.config but some folders like ```.swaylock``` and ```Scripts``` go straight in your home directory.

The ```assets``` directory doesn't contain anything needed for the setup.
